# Microprogramming Lab 2

The contents of this folder correspond to the second Computer Structure project, where we built microprogrammed control sequences and documented each checkpoint for the lab.

## Highlights
- `Assignment 2 Microprogramming.pdf` and `CS-L4-Example_ASE.pdf` explain the microcode format and how to simulate the control store.
- `mc_base.txt`, `micro1.txt`, `ase_asm.txt`, and `ase_mc.txt` capture the microprogram listings that the instructor requested.

## Reviewing this project
- Inspect the `.txt` microcode files to understand the sequencing of instructions/fields; they can be loaded into the simulator provided by the course.
- This project demonstrates control-store-level thinking and microprogram flow analysis.
